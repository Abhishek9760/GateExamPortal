This (possible) next instruction is placed in the pipe and execution begins. If after the branch is finished executing, it is found that we really wanted to take the branch, then the (possible) next instruction that we had been executing is thrown out by the hardware, and we begin executing the correct instruction, the branch target.

Consider two different 5-stage pipeline machines (IF ID EX MEM WB). The first machine M resolves branches in the ID stage, uses one branch delay slot, and can fill 80 % of the delay slots with useful instructions. The second machine N resolves branches in the EX stage and uses a Predict-not-taken scheme.

Given that 35 % of the instructions are branches, 25 % of branches are taken, and that stalls are due to branches alone, what is the Speedup of machine M over machine N (up to three decimal places)?

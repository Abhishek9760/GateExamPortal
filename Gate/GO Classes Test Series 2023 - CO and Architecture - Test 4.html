The time it takes for the beginning of the sector to reach the head is known as rotational delay, or rotational latency.

A magnetic disk has average seek time of 6  ms, rotational speed of 20,000 rotations per minute (rpm), and 1024-byte sectors with 400 sectors per track. Rotational delay to access each sector is the time required for half a rotation on average.

Suppose that we wish to read a file consisting of 1400 sectors. Let us assume that the file is stored as compactly as possible on the disk. That is, the file occupies the sectors on 4 adjacent tracks, all the sectors of 3 tracks and 200 sectors of fourth track, So, only for the starting position of the file we need to necessitate seek, so the remaining adjacent tracks can be read with essentially no seek time.

The waiter apologetically explains that the restaurant can provide only a few chopsticks to be shared among the D people. Furthermore, each diner may require a different number of chopsticks to eat. For example, it is possible that one of the diners is an octopus, who for some reason refuses to begin eating before acquiring eight chopsticks. The second parameter of this scenario is C, the number of chopsticks that would simultaneously satisfy the needs of all diners at the table. For example, two octopuses would result in C=16.<br>
All the chopsticks provided by the waiter are placed in an empty glass at the center of the table and each diner obeys the following protocol:<br>
Acquire chopsticks one after one and start eating only after having the required number of chopsticks. If no more chopsticks are available then Hold the current chopsticks and wait for more chopsticks. Once all chopsticks are acquired, then eat and release all chopsticks. Also while one person is using a chopstick then unless he releases it after completion of eating, it can not be shared with any other person(i.e. Chopsticks are used in mutual exclusion manner).</p>

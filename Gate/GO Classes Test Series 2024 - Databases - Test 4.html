<div><span>Q1</span> - <p>In B^+ trees, Data is present only at leaves. So, to get record pointer of any key, we always have to traverse from root node to leaves. Records in leaves require more Disk I/O’s to access.</p>

We run the following SQL query :</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-sql" data-pbcklang="sql" data-pbcktabsize="4">
SELECT * FROM R WHERE k    gt; 32 AND k    lt; 179;
</pre>

<p>What is the minimum number of disk I/O's required to retrieve the Index blocks containing the record pointers (not including the disk I/O's to read the actual records) of the records desired by the given query?</p><hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"></div><div><span>Q2</span> - Recall that in a B-tree of order p, Each node has at most p tree pointers. Each node, except the root and leaf nodes, has at least ⌈( p / 2)⌉ tree pointers. The root node has at least two tree pointers unless it is the only node in the tree. A node with q tree pointers, q ≤ p, has q - 1 (search key field value, data pointer) pairs. All leaf nodes are at the same level. Leaf nodes have the same structure as internal nodes except that all of their tree pointers are NULL.

We build a B-tree of order 5 by inserting the following letters in the given order, one after one.

    A, G, F, B, K, D, H, M, J, E, S, I, R, X, C, L, N, T, U, P

The number of Node splits that happen while insertion of these letters into the B tree is _______<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"></div><div><span>Q3</span> - A B-Tree of order m is an m-way search tree in which every node ,except root node, has at least m/2 children.
The height of a one level tree is defined to be 0, the height of a tree with two levels is defined to be 1, and so on.
What is the minimum number of distinct keys (or records) stored in a B Tree of height 5 and order 5?<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"></div><div><span>Q4</span> - In a B-tree, we store both keys and record pointers in the internal and leaf nodes, but in a B^+ tree, we store the record pointers in the leaf nodes only.

The main advantage of B^+ trees over B trees is that B^+ trees allow us to pack in more tree pointers to the internal nodes by removing pointers to data, thus increasing the fanout and potentially decreasing the depth of the tree.

Leaf node of B^+ tree has one block pointer which points to the sibling to the right of the tree.

Given that the block size is 1  K bytes, data record pointer is 7 bytes long, the value field is 9 bytes long and a block pointer is 6 bytes long.

If we use B tree index, then the maximum number of record pointers that can be stored in the index of height 1 is X, whereas If we use B^+ tree index, then the maximum number of record pointers that can be stored in the index of height 1 (i.e. two levels) is Y, then Y-X is _______<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray"></div><div><span>Q5</span> - <p>B^+ Tree is constructed by parameter n</p>

We want to find out the minimum number of disk IOs required to retrieve the record pointers (not including the disk IOs to read the actual records).
